#1. (8/10) Please write down c_i and c_j in explicit forms, not recursive. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Solving linear system w.r.t. c_i and c_j will give c_i = (-A_{jj}[g_k]_i + A_{ij}[g_k]_j)/(A_{ii}A_{jj}-A_{ij}^2)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ and c_j = (-A_{ii}[g_k]_j + A_{ij}[g_k]_i)/(A_{ii}A_{jj}-A_{ij}^2). You should also mention that the denominator will never be zero, which is true since the principal minor of any spd matrix is invertible.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
